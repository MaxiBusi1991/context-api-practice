# useContext practice

In this repository I used the useContext hook. It is a tool that allows information to be shared between components in an easy and simple way. With useContext, components can access data and functions from a shared context without having to manually pass props through multiple levels of components.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
